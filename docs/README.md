**Real automated API testing with real data.**   

**Relieve the pain points**:  
	1. Reduce the cost of the API testing  
	2. Improve interface test coverage  
	
**The Application Programming Interface testing** is a type of software testing, which includes two types of testing: in a narrow sense, it refers to testing directly against the functions of the application program interface (abbreviated as API testing); Indicators such as functional completion, reliability, security and performance. The activities of interface testing include, test design, test case writing, test script writing, test data construction, test execution, and further, in the process of continuous development and maintenance, Ongoing inspection and maintenance of these four active outputs is to be carried out.  
**AREX it can** minimize the implementation cost of test activities, improve test coverage, improve quality, and release more development engineers and test engineers' time.
