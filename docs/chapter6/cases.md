# use case management
* AREX now implements the addition, deletion and modification of API requests, and the addition, deletion and modification of CASE
* API request execution and response parsing
* Script execution
* Features under development: batch execution of use cases, batch execution reports, etc.


## Fast Request (Request)
* Set the request type GET, etc.
* Set the request Body
* Set request headers
* Configure the Authorization of the request
* Pre-Script script before configuration request
* Design and setup ASSERT scripts

## Test case (CASE)
* The CASE type is similar to Request, but can inherit the configuration of Request, reducing the cost of use case design
